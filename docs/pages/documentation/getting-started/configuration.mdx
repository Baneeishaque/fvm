# Configuration

Configure FVM and IDEs for better support for different development environments.

## Project

FVM will create a relative symlink in your project from `.fvm/flutter_sdk` to the cache of the selected version. Add it to your `.gitignore`

```yaml title=".gitignore"
.fvm/flutter_sdk
```

## FVM

### Cache Directory

You can configure the **fvm** cache directory by setting `FVM_HOME` environment variable. If nothing is set the default **fvm** path will be used. You are also able to change the directory by setting the `--cache-path` on the config. See below

### Config

There are some configurations which you can change on FVM. **All settings set on CLI are compatible with the Sidekick(GUI)**.

### Different Flutter Repo

You can use a different Flutter repo, a fork or as a local cache, by setting the `FVM_GIT_CACHE` environment variable.

#### List config

```bash
> fvm config
```

#### Set cache path

Location where Flutter SDK versions will be stored. If nothing is set, the default will be used.

```bash
> fvm config --cache-path <CACHE_PATH>
```

## IDE

<Callout>
  You might have to restart your IDE and the Flutter debugger to make sure it
  uses the latest version of the configurations in some situations.
</Callout>

### Android Studio

1. Go to `Languages & Frameworks > Flutter` or search for Flutter and change Flutter SDK path.
2. Copy the **_absolute_** path of fvm symbolic link in your root project directory. Example: `/absolute-project-path/.fvm/flutter_sdk`
3. Apply the changes.
4. Restart Android Studio to see the new settings applied.

<Callout type="warning">
For Android Studio to detect the dynamic change of SDKs, the installed SDK must have finished setup.

Using `fvm install <VERSION>` will ensure that setup during install.

If you have installed through another command and setup was not completed. You can finish by just running `fvm flutter --version`

Android Studio might take a few seconds to detect the dynamic SDK change.

</Callout>

If you want to ignore the Flutter SDK root directory within Android Studio you can add the following to `.idea/workspace.xml`.

```xml
<component name="VcsManagerConfiguration">
  <ignored-roots>
    <path value="$PROJECT_DIR$/.fvm/flutter_sdk" />
  </ignored-roots>
</component>
...
```

If that doesn't work, go to Android Studio -> Preferences -> Editor -> File Types -> Ignored Files and Folders and add `flutter_sdk`:
