# Overview

You can have the default Flutter version on your machine and still preserve dynamic switching. This allows you to make no changes to how you currently use Flutter, but benefit from faster switching and version caching.

<Callout type="warning">
  It is recommended that you install FVM as a standalone executable instead of
  through pub.dev to avoid dependency conflicts.
</Callout>

If you are configuring a global version, FVM will check if the global version is set in your environment path. If it is not, it will provide you with the path that needs to be configured.

### Link global version

To accomplish this, FVM provides you with a helper command to configure a global version.

```bash
fvm global {version}
```

Now you will be able to do the following.

```bash title="Example"
# Set beta channel as global
fvm global beta

# Check version
flutter --version # Will be beta release

# Set stable channel as global
fvm global stable

# Check version
flutter --version # Will be stable release
```

<Callout type="info">
  After you run the command, FVM will check if the global version is configured
  in your environment path. If it is not, it will provide you with the path that
  needs to be configured.
</Callout>
