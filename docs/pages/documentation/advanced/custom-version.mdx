# Custom Flutter Version

You can use custom Flutter versions (forks) within FVM cache.

FVM will use and run any directory that inside the cache version directory. If there is a version called `custom_name` you are able to do the following.

```bash
fvm use [custom_name]
```

<Callout type="info">

Run `fvm list` to view the cache directory, and the current cached versions.

</Callout>
